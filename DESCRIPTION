Description: An implementation of the full-likelihood Bayes factor (FLB) 
    for evaluating segregation evidence in clinical medical genetics. The method 
    was introduced by Thompson et al. (2003) <doi:10.1086/378100>, and further 
    popularised by Bayrak-Toydemir et al. (2008) <doi:10.1016/j.yexmp.2008.03.006>.
    This implementation allows custom penetrance values and liability classes, and 
    includes specialised pedigree visualisations.
